I've been using vs-code's multi cursor extensively. It's super powerful but I always found myself trying to matching too many variables or component. Well, not anymore!

( CMD + ) Alt + C for case sensitive toggleFindCaseSensitive
( CMD + ) Alt + W for match whole word toggleFindWholeWord
( CMD + ) Alt + R for using regular expressions toggleFindRegex. Is it meaningful to use regular expressions to find occurrences? I'm not sure but I'm glad it's a thing.
